The R script called zoopindex_run_model contains code to run VAST models for copepods, zooplankton volume, and euphausiids

It creates indicators of abundance and center of gravity for spring and fall for each 

Each VAST model run (including producing all the plots) takes between 1.5-2 hours

There are a total of 2 + 2 + 6 (calfin, large copepods, small copepods) models to run

Total run time for all SOE indicators is estimated to be ~ 20 hours

As a test,
I (Adelle) ran the euphausiid VAST models using the same data as last year 
I created the 4 indices from the Euphausiid models and saved to the Indices subfolder
